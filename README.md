# mindloop
MindLoop is a neural control engine for humanoid robotics. It predicts and performs next actions using modular body control, helping robots solve real-world surplus tasks. Designed to accelerate embodied AI before we reach Kardashev Type 2.

## Brain Components
See `docs/anatomy.md` for an overview of the brain component system. Each brain region can be trained separately so tasks that depend heavily on motor control or planning can focus on the relevant modules.
